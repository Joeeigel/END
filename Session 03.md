# Season 3 - Session Three

Players attending: Adfiel, Bog, Kurt

When we last left our heroes, they had worked their way through a Xanathar Guild hideout and had found **Floon Blagmaar** and were about to take him back to **Volo** in **The Yawning Portal**

The party arrives back in **The Yawning Portal**, Volo stands up right away to greet the party, but more importantly, his buddy **Floon.** The leads the party back to his table, trying to make room between the stacks of plates and mugs he's accrued since practically living here. Volo lets out a sigh and the mood turns slightly sombre. He follows up by saying "I confess that I have but few coins to spare. But never let it be said that Volo reneges on a promise. Allow me to present something much more valuable." He holds out a scroll tube. ''The deed to a remarkable property here in Waterdeep! We'll need a magistrate to witness the transfer of ownership." Kurt was a little apprehensive but Volo assured him it was worth more than the simple 100 gold pieces he had offered them. The party agrees and then travelled up to Trollskull Alley.

When getting there, the gang realized how dilapidated the inn was, and started expressing concerns on how long and how much money it would take to get it fixed up. After giving the place a once over, a small paper bird flew in through the window and landed at Kurt's feet. Unfolding it revealed a note:

"Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance." also attached to the back were 3 tickets to The Fall Of Tiamat, an opera sang in Giant.

Adfiel was instantly on board, even if it just meant getting to enjoy an opera, while bog seemed unphased, possibly never even have heard the word "opera" before. Deciding that they needed to get real formal attire, the party headed out off the inn and down towards the market. Kurt spoke to a group of buskers outside, who pointed him towards the street of silks in the Castle Ward. Whilst walking down the street, the group came across The Golden Thread, a shop that had regal-looking clothes in their window. Venturing inside the group starts to look through the racks of clothes. Kurt and Bog both find white suits, with blue and orange inner lining respectively, while Adfiel found a black dress with red trim. 

Once it was time to head to the opera, the group walks up to the box office, shows the tickets, and then walks past general admission up to their box. The opera started and the group were enthralled with what was happening, even if they couldn't understand what was being said. 

As the lights came up for intermission, a large man lets himself into the party's box and introduces himself as Mirt. He mentions Ranaer said they were a good hand, and he had a job that he hoped they could do. He asked the group to find a talking mare called Maxeene. He asked if the party could find out if she knew the whereabouts of any *Zhent* operatives, and to report back to his mansion if they found anything. Mirt then excused himself and let the party enjoy the rest of the opera.

The party ventured down to the market, in the north of the Castle Ward, where drays in the city are often trying to get fares. A drunk Kurt just starts yelling "Maxeene!" at the top of his lungs, and thanks to this,  Bog notices a horse trying to avoid Kurt as best she can. Adfiel talks to Maxeene, who agrees to tell the party what she knows, as long as Kurt keeps quiet. She reveals that she picked up a Sun Elf, and her Half Orc bodyguard from an intersection the other day, and dropped them off at **The Yawning Portal**, though she couldn't recall which intersection she picked them up from. 

Satisfied with what Maxeene had given them, the gang headed back to Mirt's and told him what he knew. In return he gave them some pins in the sign of the harper, allowing other members of the group to identify them if needed.
