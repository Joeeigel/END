# Season 3 - Session Two

When we last left our heroes, they had just found **Ranaer Neverember** hiding at a Zhentarim hideout on Candle Lane, they brought him back to **The Yawning Portal** before heading back out the next morning to head into the sewers in search for **Floon Blagmaar** at the request of **Volothamp Geddarm.**

The party ventured into the sewers, a putrid stream flows along the sewer tunnel, which led in two directions. In one direction, they saw a tiny symbol drawn on the wall in yellow chalk: a palm-sized circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating out from its circumference. Using what they had learnt from the Kenku in the hideout, the party started to follow the chalk markings. After an hour of following signs through the tunnels, they came to a three-way intersection where a ladder leads up into a stone shaft capped by a circular metal cover. One of the familiar chalk symbols is marked on a wall nearby, and floating near the symbol is a spherical, grapefruit-sized creature with a bulging central eye and four stumpy eyestalks. It bared its teeth at you. The creature fired a beam out of one of its eyes at Adfiel, barely missing her and hitting the excrement laden floor next to her. Fundin and Ez instantly jumped into action, Ez shooting one of its eyestalks with her bow while Fundin comes in for the finishing blow, crushing it like a watermelon. Fundin then climbed the ladder, checking the metal cap for any signs of it being disturbed recently, though when he determined it hadn't been moved, he decided to dislodge it himself and peer inside, though he saw dusty crates and broken furniture. He decided it probably wasn't worth going any further and the party went on as before, following the chalk symbols.

After about another hour of wading through a 1ft deep river of water and sewage, the main sewer tunnel expanded into a circular hub with a pair of arrow slits carved into its outer walls, directly across from each other. Two passages continued to the north and south. Astone door is set into the back wall of a stone ledge to the west. Bog managed to sneak up to both of the arrow slits, and noticed that each room had 2 sleeping goblins inside., he managed to get to the stone ledge and signalled for the rest of the party to come across to him quietly. Ez was the first to try and cross, and she managed to do it without issue, however, her wolf didn't understand the whole "being quiet" part of the instructions and splashed through the water loud enough to wake the goblins in both of the guardrooms. Fundin put his shield up against the slit to allow Adfiel to cross, and then followed himself. As Kurt crossed, he used sacred flame through the arrow slit, attempting to burn the two off the goblins so that he can cross successfully. While he couldn't see any carnage, he did at least hear a few goblin screams.

Once the party had successfully crossed and made it to the stone ledge, Bog opened the stone door which was slightly recessed into the wall, leading to a short 15ft corridor. As the party stepped into the corridor, however, arrows started flying at them from a slit at the end, attached to one of the guardrooms that the party had awoken just moments ago. Fundin offers to go first, putting up his shield to block arrows where he can. They get to another door and hurry through if just to get out of arrow fire. The door led into a mostly empty room, just some rusted weapons threadbare clothing strewn across the floor. As they entered the room a bit further, one arrow flew at the group and clacked across the cold stone floor. Ez drew her bow and fired back in the direction the arrow came from, and a goblin stumbles down a dark stairway before collapsing in the corner. The second goblin was waiting around the corner for the party so that he might jump them, however, Bog was somehow expecting this and came around the corner fists ready and beat the goblin to a pulp.

After the goblins were dispatched, the party headed down the dark stairway, looping back under the sewer and into what looked to be an empty sleeping chamber, with six tattered straw-stuffed mattresses and nothing else, however Adfield, Ez and Kurt all heard sounds of struggling coming from the door. Kurt took the lead in opening the door, with Ez having an arrow drawn over his shoulder. They see a duergar and a human trying to hold up and barricade a door. The group recognized the human as the guy from **The Yawning Portal** who had started a fight with the half-orc. The human breaks away from the door and draws his sword at the group, however, Ez fires her bow hitting him in his shoulder and staggering him. Adfiel and Bog come in and try closing the gap to the duergar, while Ez takes another shot at the human, hitting him directly between the eyes. The sugar, realizing he's outnumbered, then closed his eyes and vanished before the eyes of the group. Before they had any time to process what was going on, the door he was trying to hold shut became ajar, and a grey ooze slowly seeped out of it, eroding and decaying anything it came in contact with. Adfiel with some quick thinking stuck her hand into the ooze, causing herself pain, however, this allowed her to channel her wrath of the storm, sending lightning throughout the ooze, and causing it to massively shrink in size. Kurt then finished it off with a sacred flame, taking all the glory for himself. 

The heroes then step through the non-bathroom door and head up a flight of stairs. Threadbare curtains hang on the east wall of a long hall, in the middle of which a muscular half-ore in dingy robes stands with his foot on the chest of a male human with wavy red-blond hair. Fire burns around the orc's clenched fist and his victim cries and squirms helplessly beneath him. Seated on a raised platform to the south is [a nightmarish figure wearing black robes. It has large white eyes and rubbery purple skin, with four tentacles encircling its inhuman mouth. It cradles and gently caresses what looks like a disembodied brain with feet.](https://i.imgur.com/hjSTr4L.png) As the group approached the orc, the figure tossed a brain into the fray and then headed through a large door on the west wall of the room. Kurt and the half-orc have a sacred flame-off, of which Kurt comes out on top. Ez's wolf and Bog do their best to dispatch the brain, while Adfiel tends to the Human male who was pinned down by the half-orc. The Human claimed to be **Floon Blagmaar** and the party then escorted him back to **The Yawning Portal** to meet up with **Volo**
