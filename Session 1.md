# Season 3 - Session One

When we last left our heroes they had set sail from **Xesco** on a sailing ship gifted to them by the mayor of **Xesco**, as a reward for helping quell their constant snake attacks.

After sailing for several weeks, the party noticed land ahead, after sailing along the coast for a suitable place to dock, they came across a large walled port, guarded by statues of Umberlee, goddess of the sea. Once docked the group asked a sailor where is a good place for people new to the city, who told them as they look like a party of adventurers, **The Yawning Portal** could be what they're after.

The party got to The Yawning Portal reasonably quickly following the directions from the sailor. As they enter, the atmosphere is one of joy and glee, it seems as though a party of adventurers are about to lower themselves into a large pit in the centre of the taproom and are just checking their supplies one last time before taking the plunge. The party grabs a table, a barmaid comes over and offers them ale and food. Shortly after their food and drinks arrive, a shout eclipses the usual sounds of drunken adventurer song and bards strumming their lutes off-key: 
>"Ya pig! Like killin' me mates do ya?"  

Quickly glancing over the party manages to see a 7-foot tall half-orc take a wild swinging punch from a male human, who's head is completely shaven and covered in eye-shaped tattoos, and to his back stand four other humans ready to back him up.

A crowd quickly forms around the brawl about to ensue. The half-orc takes a quick swing with the back of her fist back at the human, instantly knocking him out. The other four humans start trying to help their friend back to his feet when suddenly the innkeeper shouts across the taproom for them to "Cut it out and piss off." While trying to drag their friend out of the inn, shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the taproom-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and bloodshot eyes. As it bears its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, who shouts, "Troll!" 

Most patrons start to flip any furniture near them to give themselves cover and protect themselves from the swooping stirges. One of them swoops down in the crowd where Fundin in stood, however just before it manages to get a bite on him, his old friend Kurt emerges from the crowd and casts a protection spell on him, distracting him from his war hammer swing, but also saving him from having his blood sucked. One of the stirges manages to stick itself into the back of Bog, who starts punching himself in the shoulder to try and squash it, which after a few attempts he does. Adfiel is trying to keep the troll back from the crowd, and as it takes a swing at her, a gigantic bolt of lightning with a monstrous thunder crack comes in through the ceiling and strikes the troll, knocking it back and getting it tangled in the rigging above the pit. While it is tangled up it tries to take a bite at Bog, who punches its tooth out, and Fundin gets the killing blow with his war hammer, crushing its skull.

Once all the commotion of the troll and the bar fight had settled down, somebody pushes against the tide of patrons and up to you, saying "You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?" The figure who approached you strokes his moustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. 
>"**Volothamp Geddarm**, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.   
"My friend's name is **Floon Blagmaar**. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?"

After a bit of questioning, the party discovers Floon is a handsome man with wavy red-blonde hair. When Volo last saw him he was dressed in a princely garb, and they were drinking at **The Skewered Dragon**, a dark bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward.

The party takes Volo up on his offer, and starts heading over to the skewered dragon. As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. "Get on," she says. "Nothing to see here." The party does manage to find a route around the cordon and gets back on track to the Skewered Dragon.

Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighbourhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings. One nearby shop stands out from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed beholder. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out "**Old Xoblob Shop**."

The party is cautious of the store, initially deciding against going in, however, Kurt's curiosity gets the better of him. A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop's door as he peers inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet. The hairless old gnome sitting cross-legged on the counter wears plum-coloured robes. His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes. 

The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lavender smoke before raising a hand. 
>"Hail and well met! Come browse the shelves of the most curious curiosity shop in the world!"

*GM Note: This shop is my favourite in the game because of how ridiculous his wares are*

Kurt looks in and starts browsing the shelves for anything of note, however, the only thing that caught his eye was a bracelet made of rusty fishing hooks. Taken back by the weirdness of both the wares and the atmosphere of the store Kurt begins to question the gnome who soon identifies himself as Xoblob. Xoblob said he's simply trying to run a business, and if Kurt would like to try anything out. He then hands Kurt a small paper fan, which Kurt attempts to use to cool himself, however when the fan flutters, no air is moved by it. This starts to anger Bog, who thinks Xoblob is just playing games or toying with the group, so he tries to intimidate Xoblob to see what is going on. At this point, Kurt and Adfiel both notice that the stuffed beholder in the window has turned to face inwards. Xoblob reveals that he did see somebody a few nights ago matching Floon's description, and another man similar in appearance and bearing was attacked outside his store by men in black leather armour. He thinks 5 men attacked them, and one of them had a tattoo of a winged snake on his neck. The party, mostly sure Xoblob wasn't involved, then leave him and his weird shop in peace.

The group then arrives at The Skewered Dragon which looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards. Kurt goes up to the bar to order drinks, and if they have any bar snacks, some of those too. When the barmaid brings over their drinks Adfiel asks her if she knows anything about Floon. She remembers him fairly well, as with his garb he stood out like a sore thumb compared to their usual patrons. She remembers Floon was drinking with Volo however, Volo left in the early evening while Floon stayed, and somebody else joined him. One of the other patrons chimed up "**Renaer**? Chip off the old block, just a spoiled rich noble who loves to rub our noses in it" Floon and Ranaer stayed, gambling with some patrons on some Three Dragon Ante before leaving around midnight however they didn't leave alone as she also recalls five other patrons leaving shortly after them. The five men haven't returned to the tavern since, but are known to frequent a warehouse down on Candle Lane, one of the other patrons piped up again "Just look for the snake symbol on the door, you'll know it."

As the party travelled deeper into candle lane gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon and as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.  You followed the street until you got to the lamp, at which point Bog then investigated and spotted the snake symbol on a building opposite. Assuming there are people inside, Adfiel, Bog and Kurt devised a plan to split up, one going through the main door, the other two going through a window in the back. As the plan starts to unfold, one thing that nobody noticed was that the main door to the warehouse that Bog was entering through was rigged up to a bell, so and sense of surprise was lost. Kurt panicked and threw a rock through the window and tried to dive in himself. 

As they get a closer look at what has happened in the main room tables and chairs have been carelessly tossed across the floor. The corpses of a dozen men lie along the walls, their rapiers and daggers lying nearby. On the north side of the area, stairs rise to an open level above. Four short, avian creatures with long beaks and black feathers look over in surprise from where they stand in the middle of the warehouse. Each wears a hooded cloak and wields a shortsword. Seeing the gore in front of them and seeing them brandishing weapons, Bog springs into action, getting them in a chokepoint between some large crates, while Adfiel and Kurt come up from the rear and assist. After vanquishing three of them, and a close call from Bog, the final birdman starts shouting several things, each in a different voice. In a deep voice carrying an orcish accent, it yells "Xanathar sends its regards." It then switches to a thin nasally voice "Tie up the pretty boy in the backroom" "Follow the yellow signs in the sewers." And finally, in a scratchy voice, "No time to loot the place, just get him to the boss."

After searching upstairs and downstairs, not finding much Kurt deemed of value the party breaks into the room below the stairs, as the door falls off of its hinges a strong smell of sour fish and vinegar starts to fill the air. Looking inside it is filled with discarded rope, canvas tarpaulins and splintered wood from smashed barrels. There is also a human hiding amongst this all, fitting Floon's description, however upon questioning the party discovered this is actually his drinking buddy Renaer, and that Floon must've been taken to the "boss" instead.

Shortly after finding Renaer the city watch arrives and makes their presence known. Initially, it looks as if the captain of the watch is going to chew the party out for trespassing on a crime scene, or worse, however, he notices that they have nobility with them, so he adjusts his stance, attempting to look more professional and impress. He hands them a copy of the Waterdeep code legal and sends them on their way. The party then heads back to the Yawning Portal and rests before attempting to find Floon in the morning.
